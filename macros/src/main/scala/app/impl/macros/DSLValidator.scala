/**
  * Created by pabloperezgarcia on 09/07/2017.
  *
  * With Macros we can create functions that they will be invoke in compilation-time.
  * This is achieve thanks that we use the operator 'macro' before the invocation of the function.
  * Because of that the compiler know that he have to check that function in compilation time.
  *
  * Thanks to macros you have a new world of possibilities when youÂ´e designing a DSL or any other code in your
  * project that require compilation and not runtime errors.
  *
  * First thing to be aware of is the Context, in this case blackbox, which is the responsible
  * to interact with the compiler, and do actions as abort, error or warning.
  *
  * context.Tree wraps an abstract syntax tree and tags it with its type in this case String.
  *
  * Then using this tree we can use pattern matching to get the invocation value, using Literal and
  * specifying the type through Constant.
  *
  * Once that we have the value itÂ´s up to us to the business logic that we want, and then allow the continue
  * of the compilation returning the tree, or abort the compilation or throw an error, or just an echo or warning.
  *
